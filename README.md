## Instruction

Do a js file that exposes methods to :

create a deck of 52 standard cards each one with a value (Ace, 2, 3..., 10, Jack, Queen, King) and a color (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs)
shuffle the deck

draw the n firsts cards from the deck

sort the deck by values (all Aces, all 2s...)

sort the deck by color (all spades with Ace first, 2, 3..., all hearts...)

Think of this deck.js file as the first step to a poker program.
